    <h2>how to respond to catcalls: a crowdsourced compendium</h2>
    <ul><li>you're walking on a sidewalk with a girlfriend when a man walks past you and catcalls, you immediately release a very loud fart. you both smile prettily and walk away.</li>
      <li>you're walking on a sidewalk with headphones when someone rolls down the window of a car that's waiting in traffic. he mentions something about his dick. you slowly take out your ear buds and saunter on over the car. you open the door and take a seat. you say "ok let's see it than." before he can respond you pull out a switch blade and smile.</li>
      <li>you're on the subway when catch eyes with someone opposite from you. he grins creepily. you look away and focus on reading the advertisements above his head. he says why don't you smile honey. you look back at the man. you attempt a smile but your mouth actually slithers off your face, teeth clacking on the ground. next your nose drops into your lap. your eyes pop out into your hands and eyebrows flutter off like fall leaves. you look at the man and raise up your pieces of your face to him. </li></ul>
